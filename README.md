TODO
----
    * support for other virtualization technology (KVM, VirtualBox)

Requirements
------------

Required

    - Python > 2.5.x (tested with 2.5.2, 2.7.3)
    - Python module Beautiful Soup (tested with bs3)
    - lsb-release (detection of Linux distribution and release)

Optional

    - smbios-utils (HW Vendor, Server model and Service-Tag)
     - if you don't use smbios-utils, script generate random servicetag in /etc
    - LLDPd (information about interface connection with switches and other devices)
    - Dell OMSA (for information about iDRAC configuration)

Installation
------------

You should install this application whare you want. I reccommend put it to /opt.

    cd /opt/
    git clone https://github.com/rvojcik/rt-server-client.git
    vim rt-server-client/conf/main.conf
    cd rt-server-client
    ./system-info.py

If it ends without any message, it was successful. Look into RackTables web interface for new object.

Add to root crontab following line for run script every 30 minutes
   */30 * * * * cd /opt/rt-server-client ; ./system-info.py

Normaly script ends without any output. If something go wrong it returns some output of the error. 

Issues
------

Known problem is with Python Beautiful Soup module. 
You should install it from source or from packages. 
Name of module depends on version, inux distribution etc.

If you see someting like this:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./system-info.py", line 60, in <module>
        from ToolBox import net, dell
      File "./lib/ToolBox/dell/__init__.py", line 22, in <module>
        import bs3
    ImportError: No module named bs3

Edit please lib/ToolBox/dell/__init__.py and change "import bs3" to correct name of BeautifulSoup
module (eg. bs4, BeautifulSoup ... )
